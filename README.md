Classes for manipulating 3d objects 
===============

Work in progress...

Does not use GNU autotools for configure, instead goofy shell script...sorry!

Part of alib, can't be used standalone.

Very very un-optimized, slow, and inefficient.

Brain dead implementation of object, vertex, face, etc lists.

Trivial texture support.

Lighting and cameras not fully implement.

Missing a lot of what you'd expect to actually be here!

Can use OpenGL, but includes simple wireframe renderer.
